# What is an interview guide ?

- An interview guide is a document that enables organizations to structure the way they conduct their candidate interviews. It helps interviewers to know what to ask about and in what order and it ensures a candidate experience that is the same for all applicants.
- Typically, an interview guide is a page long and contains guidelines for certain questions and topics that the interviewer might discuss with candidates.
- It may also include topics to avoid to ensure that the interview complies with labor laws and industry regulations.

## What does an interview guide include?

- An interview guide contains information about the company and the position, along with suggested questions and topics. It might also include space for the interviewer to record the candidate's responses.
- While the exact content of each guide might depend on the department or company's hiring goals, these resources may include the following components:

    - Information about the company and position
    - Sample questions or question types
    - Follow-up questions, depending on the candidate's responses
    - Information about the hiring process to use in a conclusion

## Making an interview guide.

### 1. Determine which position or department needs guides.

- A hiring team might analyze the costs and benefits of creating interview guides for different positions. Interview guides may be beneficial for new businesses hiring for many roles quickly.
- A guide can help streamline and organize the interview process and provide similar results for managers to review together. We might also create standard guides for departments since employees in a department might share experience or common skills. For example: A sales department might have an interview guide for all sales positions, including sales support specialists and account managers.
- 
### 2. Meet with employees in that position

- Speaking to employees currently holding each position can provide valuable insights into the work environment, soft skills and culture related to the position. We can incorporate relevant questions into our interview guide using this information. For example: If sales managers explain that they work independently and rarely collaborate, you may ask candidates questions about their experiences working alone to complete projects.
 
### 3. Identify the necessary and useful skills for a role.

- You can review the job description or meet with department managers to identify key skills and qualifications required for an open position. Some skills are necessary. For instance, accountants need knowledge about current tax codes. Other skills may not be required but are helpful in the role. For example, being familiar with popular tax software, while not a necessity, enhances a candidate's application for an accountant position.Related: Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills: What's the Difference?

### 4. Choose question types

- Choose which types of questions can help you learn the most about a candidate. Generally, interview guides include a mix of question types. These can include:

    - Closed-ended questions: 
        - Closed questions require a simple word or phrase answer, such as, "Where did you go to college?"
    - Open-ended questions:
      - Open-ended questions require more thought-out, explanatory answers. These may also include verification questions related to information on a candidate's resume or cover letter.
    - Opinion questions:
      - Opinion questions ask interviewees to provide their opinion or preference. For instance, you may ask, "What project management programs do you find the most effective?"
    - Behavioral questions:
      - Behavioral questions ask for specific examples of a certain skill, like communication or problem-solving.
    - Case questions:
      - Case questions pose a scenario to candidates and ask how they might address it. For example, you might ask, "If your department only achieved 50% of its quarterly sales goals, what might you do to remedy the situation?"
    - Pose a single question at a time so that interviewees can focus on one question. Then, you can ask follow-up questions to allow the candidate to clarify or expand their answers.

### 5. Organize your interview guide.

- Put your interview guide in a logical order. It usually makes sense to start with easier verification and closed questions before moving on to open-ended questions, like behavioral and case questions. Consider organizing your questions from general to specific, like this progression of questions:

    ```txt
    How did you get into marketing?
    What was your favorite part about your last job?
    Can you tell me about a time you worked with a challenging client?
    ```

- Then, add any necessary information about the company and the position at the beginning of the document. You can also add concluding remarks that describe the hiring process so the candidate knows what to expect.

### 6. Distribute your interview guide.

- Share your interview guide with those who conduct or take part in interviews. This may include:

    - Hiring managers
    - Recruiters
    - Human resources staff
    - Department directors
    - Employees who conduct peer interviews

- You might also send copies to employees who currently hold the position so they can provide feedback on your questions.
