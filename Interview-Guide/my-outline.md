# My Approach to making a user guide.

- This is my approach to making a user guide for the exercise.

## 1. Define My Objective

- My goal is to identify stress points, habits, and behaviors related to going on holidays with friends, particularly what might make the experience more comfortable and enjoyable.

**Objective Example:**

- To understand common pain points, communication gaps, and logistical challenges that lead to stress during holidays with friends and explore possible areas for improvement.

## 2. Hypotheses (1-3)

- Formulating hypotheses that I want to explore during the interviews.

Examples:

    - Misaligned expectations between friends are a primary cause of holiday stress.
    - Lack of clear planning and budgeting leads to tension among group members.
    - Poor communication about activities results in conflicting holiday plans.

## 3. Select 3 to 5 Main Topics


- Topics:

    - Planning and Coordination
    - Budget and Expenses
    - Communication Preferences
    - Personal Preferences and Expectations
    - Logistics and Transportation

## 4. Write 1-3 Open-Ended Questions Per Topic

- Craft questions that encourage users to share their experiences, feelings, and behaviors.

- Example Questions:

    - Planning and Coordination:
        "Can you describe the last holiday you went on with friends? How did you plan it?"
        "What challenges did you encounter when organizing activities with your group?"
    Budget and Expenses:
        "How do you usually manage the costs of group trips?"
        "What budgeting tools or methods, if any, do you find helpful when planning trips?"
    Communication Preferences:
        "When planning a trip with friends, how do you communicate? Tell me how you guys communicate ?"
        "Can you tell me about a time when poor communication led to a problem on a trip?"
    Personal Preferences and Expectations:
        "How do you and your friends decide on destinations and activities? If one or some of you disagree, how do you go about it ?"
        "How woud you handle it if you were invited to a gala and you felt reluctant about it ?"
    Logistics and Transportation:
        "How do you typically organize travel arrangements for group trips? What if there are recurring issues ?"

## .5 Write Screening Questions for Demographics

- Collect demographic data for context.

- Examples:

    "How old are you?"
    "What do you do to earn a living ?"
    "Where are you located?"
    "Do you go on holidays? If yes, how often do you make it with friends? If no, why do you prefer it that way?"

## 6. Structure Questions in a Funnel

- Begin with general questions and gradually focus on specific issues.

    Broad: "Can you tell me about your last holiday trip with friends?"
    Focused: "What was the biggest challenge you faced during that trip?"
    Specific: "How did you handle disagreements about expenses?"

## 7. Greeting Introduction

Prepare an introductory message for participants.

Example Greeting:
"Hi, my name is [John Doe], and I'm conducting an interview to understand the challenges people face when going on holidays with friends. Our goal is to learn more about your experiences to make group trips more enjoyable. I appreciate your time and openness."

## 8. Conclusion

- Wrap up the interview with thanks and potential next steps.

- Example Conclusion:

"Thank you for sharing your insights! Your experiences are invaluable. If you know anyone else who might have similar experiences, I'd love to speak with them as well. Thank you again!"
