# Ideation stage to solve the problem in the Problem statement.

## Form Groups:

- Divide participants into groups of 5.
- Within each group, split into pairs for each ideation session.
 
##  Roles:
    
**First Run:**
- One participant acts as the facilitator (guides the session, encourages idea generation, ensures everyone participates).
- The other participant acts as the time-keeper/logistics manager (tracks time, keeps the process flowing, handles any practical needs).

**Second Run:**
- Switch roles to ensure everyone has a chance to both lead and manage time.


**Idea Generation:**

- Set a specific time limit (e.g., 15-20 minutes) for brainstorming.

- Focus on generating as many ideas as possible related to the problem statement.

- No idea is too wildâ€”encourage creativity, wild thinking, and building on others' ideas.

**Narrowing Down Ideas:**

- After brainstorming, the group will use a voting process to narrow down the ideas:
- Discuss and evaluate the ideas based on criteria like feasibility, impact, and alignment with the problem statement.
- Each participant can vote on their top choices.
- Narrow down to the 3 main ideas.

**Documenting the Process:**

-   Take pictures of your team during the ideation session as evidence of the process.

-   Document the ideas generated and the criteria used to select the final three.

-   Summarize the selected ideas, noting why they were chosen.



## Ideation Process to Generate Creative Solutions for the Problem Statement: "How Might We Make Group Holidays More Enjoyable and Stress-Free for Friends?"

## Step 1: Forming Groups and Assigning Roles

**Group Members:**
    - Facilitator: Member 1 (First Run) / Member 2 (Second Run)
    - Time-keeper / Logistics: Member 2 (First Run) / Member 1 (Second Run)
    - Participants: Members 3, 4, and 5

## Step 2: Idea Generation (Time Limit: 15 Minutes)
During this phase, we generated as many ideas as possible. This is a list of potential ideas for addressing the problem:

**Group Budgeting Tool:** An app that allows friends to set budgets, track expenses in real-time, and split costs easily.

**Customized Itinerary Planner:** A platform where group members can vote on destinations and activities, creating a balanced itinerary based on everyone's preferences.

**Communication & Coordination App:** A centralized app with built-in chat, reminders, and polling to streamline group communication and reduce misunderstandings.

**Conflict Mediation Guide:** A guide or app offering conflict resolution techniques, tips, and role-playing scenarios to help diffuse potential arguments during holidays.

**Flexible Booking Options:** A service that offers flexible cancellations, shared accommodations, and "no-penalty" change options for group travel.

**Preference Matching Algorithm:** An AI-powered tool to match travel preferences (e.g., adventure vs. relaxation) among friends to recommend suitable activities and destinations.

**Emergency Help & Support:** Integration of a "Travel SOS" feature for addressing unexpected changes, emergencies, or travel disruptions in real-time.

**Friend Compatibility Survey:** A pre-trip survey that determines compatibility and travel styles to avoid conflicts during the holiday.

**Shared Task Management Board:** An app that assigns tasks like booking accommodations, preparing meals, etc., to different group members.

**Collaborative Packing Checklist:** A tool that helps friends coordinate and track items needed for the trip to ensure everyone contributes.

## Step 3: Narrowing Down Ideas (Voting Process)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
        
  **Feasibility:** How easily can this idea be implemented?
  
  **Impact:** How significantly will it reduce holiday stress?
  
  **Alignment:** Does it directly address the key pain points?
  
  **Voting:** Each group member voted on their top 3 choices.
