# PLAN

- This document will outline my working progress in the deliverale process.
- I will start by defining twhat affinity diagram and empathy map is. 


## Affinity Diagram

- An affinity diagram is a tool used in user experience (UX) design and other collaborative problem-solving processes to organize ideas or data into groups based on their natural relationships. It helps to identify patterns or themes from a large set of information by categorizing similar pieces together. Typically, it's used after brainstorming or gathering feedback, where you physically or digitally organize sticky notes (or cards) containing different insights, observations, or ideas into clusters of similar concepts.

## Empathy Map
  
- An empathy map is a tool used to visualize and understand the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors of a user or a customer in order to build empathy and inform design decisions. It typically consists of a quadrant divided into sections, each focusing on different aspects of the userâ€™s experience:

    - Says: What the user says out loud.
    - Thinks: What the user might be thinking but not saying.
    - Does: What actions or behaviors the user takes.
    - Feels: The user's emotional state during the experience.

Empathy maps help teams align their understanding of the user, guiding them in creating solutions that genuinely address the user's needs and pain points.

## Affinity Diagram Creation

- **Key Information:** Go through each of your interview scripts and identify key quotes, themes, behaviors, or challenges described by each interviewee. Each piece of information or key insight should be written down on a sticky note (either on paper, digitally, or using a tool like Miro).

- **Clustering Information:**

- Group the sticky notes by finding common themes. For instance, if multiple interviewees mention "miscommunication" as a problem, you can create a cluster around "Communication Challenges."

- **Label Clusters:** Give each cluster a clear, descriptive label.
- **Conclusions:** Draw conclusions by identifying major pain points, recurring themes, or opportunities for improvement within group holiday experiences.

## Filling Out the Empathy Map:

- **An empathy map typically includes four quadrants:** "Says," "Thinks," "Feels," and "Does." Populate these quadrants using the content you derived from the Affinity Diagram.

- **Says:** Direct quotes or statements from the interviewees (e.g., "We usually plan spontaneously, which can be chaotic.")
- **Thinks:** Insights into what the interviewees might be thinking, based on their statements (e.g., "Planning can be overwhelming without proper coordination.")
- **Feels:** Emotional responses conveyed during the interviews (e.g., "Frustrated by miscommunication" or "Anxious about sticking to a budget.")
- **Does:** Actions taken by the interviewees (e.g., "Creates group chats for holiday planning" or "Uses apps to track expenses.")

- Group Dynamics & Preferences
- Overall Experience / Challenges and Learnings

### 1. Think & Feel

- Focuses on internal thoughts, feelings, concerns, and motivations related to the trip and traveling experience.
    - Examples:
        The emotional response to planning, managing finances, and adapting to group dynamics.
        Concerns about budgeting, keeping track of expenses, and ensuring everything stays within financial limits.
